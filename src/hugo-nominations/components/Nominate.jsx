      <p>
        Thank you for participating in the 2020 Hugo Awards and the John W.
        Campbell Award! Please choose up to five eligible candidates in each
        category. We recommend that you nominate whatever works and creators you
        have personally read or seen that were your favorites from 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deadline for nominations is 17 March 2020 at 11:59pm Pacific
        Daylight Time (2:59pm Eastern Daylight Time, 0659 Greenwich Mean Time,
        0859 in Finland, all on 18 March). You can make as many changes as you
        like up to your nomination ballot until then. Your current ballot will
        be emailed to you an hour after you stop making changes to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing has changed about the mechanics of making nominations this year.
        You can still choose up to five nominees in each category. Your
        nominations are equally weighted – the order in which you list them has
        no effect on the outcome. There are some changes to the way that
        nominations are tallied to produce the final ballot; they are summarised{' '}
        <a href="http://www.worldcon.fi/wsfs/hugo/" target="_blank">
          here
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        This year we are trialling a new category, Best Series. If you make
        nominations for Best Series, it will help us if you also list a volume
        in that series that was published in 2016. Likewise, it will help us if
        you can give examples of the work of people you nominate for Best
        Professional Artist, Best Fan Artist and Best fan Writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        “No Award” will appear automatically in every single category on the
        final ballot – there is no need to include that choice on the nomination
        form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Works published in 2016 for the first time anywhere, or for the first
        time in English translation or in the United States, are eligible for
        the 2020 Hugo Awards. Books are considered to have been published in the
        year of the publication date, which usually appears with the copyright
        information on the back of the title page. If there is no stated
        publication date, the copyright date will be used instead. A dated
        periodical is considered to have been published on the cover date,
        regardless of when it was placed on sale or copyrighted. Serialized
        stories or dramatic presentations are eligible in the year in which the
        last installment appears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nominations in the written fiction and dramatic presentation categories
        may be relocated to a different category by the Hugo Awards
        Administrator if close in length to the category boundary.
      </p>
      <p>

        general questions on the Hugo process, you can e-mail{' '}
