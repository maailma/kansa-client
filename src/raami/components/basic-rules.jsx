<b>Location: Messukeskus, Hall 5</b><br/><br/>
Hours: Opening hours of Worldcon 75 Exhibits hall (TBA), closing early on Sunday for auction.<br/><br/>
To exhibit in the art show you must be a member of Worldcon 75. If you do not plan to attend and are sending your work to the show via a third party, you only need a supporting membership.<br/><br/>
To view, bid, or purchase artwork, one must have an attending Worldcon 75 membership.<br/><br/>
We welcome all styles of original art by creators from all backgrounds within the auction gallery, the print shop, and the digital gallery. Subject matter should stay under the very broad umbrella of ‘science fiction, fantasy, horror, astronomical, fannish, or related themes’.<br/><br/>
Worldcon 75 will reserve the right to leave out artworks or artists that fail to meet our quality standards or are otherwise unsuitable for the art show.<br/><br/>
Wordcon 75 art show has three sections: the auction gallery, the print shop and the digital gallery. Artists are welcome to display work in any section of the art show or in all of them.<br/><br/>
The auction gallery will contain works that may be available for purchase via written auction. Work in the auction gallery must be singular in that no other copies of that image or work may be on display in the same section, regardless of medium or size. NFS or “Not For Sale” work is allowed in the auction gallery, but we would appreciate it if at least half of your work is for sale. We expect that works receiving 5 or more bids will go to the live auction on Sunday but have not yet made a final decision on this. You may not enter works into the auction if they are also for sale in the print shop or the dealers room (but you may enter the original of a work for which you are selling prints in the print shop or the dealers room).<br/><br/>
The print shop will contain work that is available for immediate purchase. Art works placed in this section must have fixed price and be ready for immediate pick up during opening hours of the art show. There must be a minimum of five (5) identical copies of each image entered into the print shop.<br/><br/>
The digital gallery is a digital display of art works which can not be purchased (though the originals may also be entered into the auction gallery or print shop for sale as appropriate).<br/><br/>
<b>Copyright:</b><br/>
All artworks must be created by the submitting artist. If the artwork is a product of collaboration with other artist(s) that must be clearly indicated when submitting said artwork to the art show. The Worldcon 75 art show does not accept art for resale.<br/><br/>
<b>Reproduction Rights:</b><br/>
Sale of an artwork does not include any reproduction rights. Buyers who wish to reproduce an artwork must make arrangements directly with the artist.<br/><br/>
<b>Awards:</b><br/>
Only work in the auction gallery or digital gallery (not the print shop), including NFS artwork, will be eligible for awards.<br/><br/>
<b>Security (aka Turva):</b><br/>
We expect to have marked guards inside the art show area at all times while the art show is open. All art leaving the art show area must be marked clearly as sold items and have a valid receipt. Unless purchased, artwork signed into the art show may not be withdrawn, nor may any conditions of its sale (e.g., minimum bid) be changed, for the duration of the show.<br/><br/>
<b>Insurance:</b><br/>
Worldcon75 cannot provide insurance coverage for art exhibited in the show, so you should ensure that your own insurance will cover your art while it is at the show.<br/><br/>
<b>Display system:</b><br/>
The art show will be built using Messukeskus’s own display wall system. Standard wall elements are made of white hardboard. Artwork items can be attached using adhesives, screws or nails. Size of wall element is 100 × 250 cm. Therefore, the basic unit of space will be one square metre (m2) for both walls and tables.<br/><br/>
The digital gallery will have an attending fee per artist, as it will only be for displaying artworks without the possibility to purchase any of them.<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>Auction gallery: €20 / m2, wall or table</li>
<li>Print shop: €10 / m2, wall or table</li>
<li>Digital gallery: €20 / artist (maximum 20 pictures/artist)</li>
</ul>
<b>Mail-in artwork:</b><br/> 
space fee + return postage + €20. This also applies to attending artists mailing in their work. Due to the substantial effort required for our staff to store, unpack, hang, unhang, and re­pack mailed-in art, we will only allow a limited amount of it. Please do not request permission to mail your artwork unless you really are unable to find any other way to get it to and from the show. If we allow you to mail your art, you must pre­pay in full for return shipping. If you mail art to us without our prior written agreement, we will return it.<br/><br/>
Worldcon 75 will take a 10% commission on all sales.<br/><br/>
<b>Presentation:</b><br/>
All two-dimensional (flat) entries in the auction gallery must be matted, mounted, or framed, and ready to be hung. Three-dimensional work must likewise be display-ready. Work in the printshop must be mounted or matted; clearbags or sleeves are recommended as a protective measure but not required. The art show will not be liable for damage as a result of inadequate preparation.<br/><br/>
All items to be entered in any section of the art show must be finished before being put on display. All artwork in the main gallery and the print shop must be clearly and individually labeled with the title and the artist’s name(s). Title and artist name must also be provided for digital gallery works so that they can be appropriately displayed.<br/><br/>
<b>Payment:</b><br/>
Worldcon 75 will pay artists for sales of works within 45 days of the end of the convention.<br/><br/>
<b>Cancellations:</b><br/>
We will refund your fees in full if you cancel your art show booking by 15th July 2017. Refund after this point is dependent on us being able to re-sell the space, and we reserve the right to charge a fee for late cancellations.<br/><br/>
<b>Disclaimer:</b><br/>
While we fully intend these to be the policies that actually govern the Worldcon 75 art show, we reserve the right to make changes or interpretations if unforeseen circumstances arise or for accessibility reasons. Any such decisions will be guided by the spirit, rather than the letter, of these policies.<br/><br/>
